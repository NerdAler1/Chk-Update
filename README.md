# Chk&Update
A tool to check devices for RAM and Battery capacity, and update them. (Designed for use with devices that need 16gb of RAM and >64% battery health remaining.)

## Instructions
1. Plug the USB Drive into a USB port.

2. Open Terminal: Hold Shift and press F10 (You may need to hold Fn on some devices)

3. Type in “D:” in the terminal window and press enter.

4. Type in “start.bat” in the terminal window and press enter. (You can also just press Tab to autocomplete, since everything else is lower alphabetically)

5. The script will now show memory capacity and battery health (after a brief moment), then open windows update settings.

6. Check the terminal window’s output to ensure the device has 16GB of RAM and good battery health. (>=65%)

7. Run the windows updates, monitor them until they finish, and then you are done!
